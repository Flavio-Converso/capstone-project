# 📖 Project Presentation
The project involves the development of a digital distribution platform for video games, similar to _[Instant Gaming](https://www.instant-gaming.com)_ or _[G2A](https://www.g2a.com/)_. Users will be able to register, explore a catalog of games, purchase titles, and manage their profile and personal library. The application will feature a user-friendly interface and provide fundamental functionalities for managing accounts, purchases, and reviews.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The project will demonstrate skills in both **frontend** and **backend**, **database management**, and integration of **external APIs**.

## 💻 Technologies Used

### 🖥️ Frontend
- 🎨 _HTML_, _CSS_, _Bootstrap_: To create a modern and responsive user interface (_UI_).
- ✨ _JavaScript_: To manage interactivity and enhance user experience (_UX_).

### ⚙️ Backend
- 🛠 _ASP.NET MVC_: To manage application logic and communication with the database.
- 💻 _C#_: Programming language to develop business logic.

- 💾 _SQL Server_: To manage data related to users, games, purchases, and reviews.
The project will follow the "_Code First_" approach, where classes and application logic are developed first, and the database is automatically generated from the models defined in the code.
