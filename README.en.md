# 📖 Project Presentation
The project involves the development of a digital distribution platform for video games, similar to _Steam_ or _G2A_. Users will be able to register, explore a catalog of games, purchase titles, and manage their personal library. The application will feature a user-friendly interface and provide fundamental functionalities for managing accounts, purchases, and reviews.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The main goal is to create a platform that simulates the experience of an online video game store. The project will demonstrate skills in both **frontend** and **backend**, **database management**, and integration of **external APIs**. Users will be able to purchase games, leave reviews, and manage their profiles.

## 💻 Technologies Used

### 🖥️ Frontend
- 🎨 _HTML_, _CSS_, _Bootstrap_: To create a modern and responsive user interface (_UI_).
